## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed ply
ots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(plotly)))

plot_ly(cars,x =~dist, y = ~speed, color = ~speed, size = ~speed)
#plot(cars)
```
